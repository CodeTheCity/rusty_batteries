# rusty_batteries
A repo for the Rusty Batteries project at CTC17. 

The aim if this is to help citizens to better understand the best route for disposal of a household waste - and guide them to the nearest facility for that. 

## Functionality

We aim to develop a website or app that someone can use to say 
* I am _here_
* I have an _item_
* What do I do with it? 

It should offer guidance: 
* re-use it (including creative uses)
* re-cycle it at this local facility
* Phone this service to have it picked up
* Put it in your brown / green / black bin etc.

## Useful resources
We'll put useful links here for now

* Guardian - [What really happens to the waste in your recycling bin?](https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/jul/08/what-really-happens-to-the-waste-in-your-recycling-bin-podcast)
* Aberdeen City Council - [Find Your Nearest Recylcing Centre] (https://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/services/bins-and-recycling/find-your-nearest-recycling-centre)
* Search ACC website for ['batteries'](https://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/search/content?keys=batteries) - not a single result. Same with 'light bulbs'

## Next steps
* Further research 
    * Apps already developed - OS? 
    * Where DO you recylce batteries and lightbulbs? 
* Create some sort of logic / data model
