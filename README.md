# rusty_batteries
A repo for the Rusty Batteries project at CTC17. 

The aim of this project is to help citizens better understand the best route for disposal of household waste  items - and guide them to the nearest facility for that. 

Early tests of the Aberdeen City Council [Website](https://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk) showed that it was impossible to find even simple terms such as 'batteries' or 'lighht bulbs' when trying to work out how to dispose of these responsibly.

## Functionality

We aim to develop a website or app that someone can use to say: 
* I am _here_
* I have an _item_
* What do I do with it? 

It should offer guidance: 
* Re-use it (including creative uses)
* Re-cycle it at this local facility
* Phone this service to have it picked up
* Put it in your brown / green / black bin etc.

## Useful resources
We'll put useful links in [this file](links.md)


## Initial research
There are some apps and services that do most of what we are trying to do. For example [iRecycle - Iphone and Android](https://earth911.com/irecycle/) is a nice app for Android and iOS that would work were it not for US only. 

We couldn't find somthing for Scotland that worked as an app.

### Recycle For Scotland
The website [Recycle For Scotland](http://www.recycleforscotland.com/) is, on the face of it a useful means to identify what to do with a piece of domestic waste. 

BUT ...... it doesn't work as well as it could, and the content, and data behind it have no clear licence to permit reuse by others. 

#### The Issues
Searching the site, or navigating by the menus, for [Electrical Items](http://www.recycleforscotland.com/what-to-do-with/electrical-items) results in a page that is headed "This content was archived on 13th August 2018" - hardly inspiring confidence. 

Searching for what to do with batteries in Aberdeen results in a list of shops, at least one of which, closed down about 18 months ago. 

The main issue, however, is that there is no clear licence regarding reuse of the website's content. The site appears to be a rebadged version of [Recycle Now](https://www.recyclenow.com/), built for [Zero Waste Scotland (ZWS)](https://www.zerowastescotland.org.uk/content/terms-conditions).  According to ZWS's [Terms and Conditions](https://www.zerowastescotland.org.uk/content/terms-conditions) on their own site, you can't (re)use any materials from that site.

ZWS are [publicly funded[(https://www.zerowastescotland.org.uk/content/who-we-are)] by the Scottish Government and the European Regional Development Fund - all public money.

============================================
We argue that any website operated by a government agency, or department, or NDPB, should automatically be licensed under the [Open Government Licence](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/) or OGL. And any data behind that site should be licenced as Open Data so that others could reuse the data. 

The Scottish Government's own website is [fully licenced](https://www.gov.scot/crown-copyright/) under OGL. 

Changing the licening of Recycle For Scotland, making its' code open source, and making its data open would have many benefits: 
* it could be improved on by anyone
* the data could be repurposed in new applications
* errors could be corrected by a larger group than a single company maintaining it.
